# Basic Portfolio Website

I’ve wanted a portfolio website for some time, and after extensive research and trial I realized – who better to build it than me? I detail the concept, features, tools, and milestones for the project and what I’ll need to learn along the way.

## Description

Throughout my early career, I’ve had some small exposure to designers and had the privilege to see their work, displayed in all its glory – in a portfolio. It hadn’t occurred to me until a few months ago that such a tool is a valued asset in my industry. 
Once the concept took hold in my mind, I began formulating ideas, brainstorming implementation, and dreaming up all the projects my portfolio would hold.
I endeavor to detail that design process and the beginning of how I project managed the build. I hope to give you a glimpse into my creativity and drive to learn new things. I also hope to inspire all my readers to pursue a portfolio of your work, however that may look to you in your field.
It’s exciting, rewarding, and empowering. Let’s have some fun.
